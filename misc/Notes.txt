Name: Messier31 (black hole at the center of the Andromeda galaxy)

- Once the size of the largest connected free component is 1, the optimal strategy is obvious: fill up the worst x holes, where x is your number of pieces remaining.

- Disconnected free components can be played independently, except for the fact that each remaining number can be used at most once.

- Playing in larger free components should be favored over closing holes. (Unless you think you can trick your opponent to play sub-optimally in the larger component?)

- Even in the mid-game, situations may arise where some holes can no longer contribute to the final score, because they will be filled in no matter what happens in the remaining components.
 x This is quite restrictive, though: if you're losing, you may prefer to keep that (-1)-hole open

- Components quickly become trees -> solving optimal play for trees (or even paths) may be interesting

- When I create a hole that wins for me, I can assign the lowest opponent stone to that hole.
 x Not necessarily (assuming optimal play), although it may be a good time-saving optimisation

- From any position, before evaluating or planning, we can assume that both players optimally fill in the already created holes.
 x Not necessarily: depending on the holes in the area still to be played, any of the remaining holes could be the best one for us at the end

- For 2-holes, we can compute the smallest number needed to 'flip' the current winner.

- Playing a move is always better than passing (not playing anything). This means that null-move pruning should work well and not introduce any search instability. It also implies a 1st player advantage.

When playing randomly:
- The order of playing numbers does not matter
- The locations *do* matter, even if the numbers are random
- Playing non-holes before holes increases odds of winning
- Playing tiles with many adjacent free tiles also increases odds of winning
- When playing with these location constraints, playing higher numbers first *does* increase odds of winning
